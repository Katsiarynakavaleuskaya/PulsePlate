### 🌟 Frontend Development (React + Vite + Capacitor, iOS-first)
- [ ] P0 — Foundation (today/tomorrow):
  - [ ] Design system (tokens): frontend/src/styles/tokens.css with PulsePlate color palette
  - [ ] UI stack: Tailwind + clsx/cva (component variants), fonts (SF Pro/Inter)
  - [ ] Routing: react-router (routes: /, /weekly, /progress, /premium)

  - [ ] State: lightweight store (zustand) for user parameters (height/weight/sex/age/goal/activity)
  - [ ] i18n: i18next (RU/EN), translation placeholders
  - [ ] Accessibility (A11y): focus rings, contrast, 44×44pt touch targets, semantic roles

  - [ ] E2E: Playwright (main scenarios: input → calculation → save → transitions)
  - [ ] CI: GitHub Actions — lint, typing, unit/UI tests, build; preview (gh-pages or Vercel) for frontend
  - [ ] ASO package: screenshots 6.1″/6.7″ (light/dark), promo texts, 15–20 sec video screencast
