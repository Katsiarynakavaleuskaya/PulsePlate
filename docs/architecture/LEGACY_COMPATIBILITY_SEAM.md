## Context

`legacy_app.py` is still the runtime compatibility base for the FastAPI app.
`app/main.py` imports `legacy_app.app`, applies canonical additive bootstrap, and
owns new canonical route registration. This is a transitional seam, not the
desired final architecture.

The current policy is compatibility first:

- keep existing legacy routes callable when current clients still depend on
  them;
- hide or internalize legacy surfaces from public OpenAPI when the canonical
  route family owns the public contract;
- put new canonical route growth in `app/routers/` and `app/bootstrap/`, then
  register it through `app/main.py`;
- keep product truth, entitlement truth, AI runtime truth, FoodDB authority, and
  OpenAPI contract truth out of `legacy_app.py`.

## Decision

Freeze `legacy_app.py` as a compatibility seam. It may shrink or delegate more
thinly over time, but it must not grow new product behavior.

Allowed in `legacy_app.py`:

- existing compatibility aliases and response shaping;
- removal or narrowing of legacy surface;
- thin delegation to canonical routers, services, or core helpers;
- comments or markers that document the seam.

Forbidden in `legacy_app.py`:

- new `@app.*` routes;
- new `app.include_router(...)` or `app.add_api_route(...)` registrations;
- new `app.routers.*` imports for product route growth;
- new provider or LLM calls;
- new billing, entitlement, subscription, receipt, quota, or API-key behavior;
- new OpenAPI-visible public surface;
- semantic-cache serving, FoodDB cutover, DB writes, or broad refactors.

## Ownership Map

| Surface | Owner | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Existing legacy compatibility aliases | `legacy_app.py` | Runtime compatibility only; no growth. |
| Canonical app bootstrap | `app/main.py` | Additive, idempotent registration over the compatibility base. |
| New route implementations | `app/routers/` | Canonical route families own new behavior. |
| Operational health/readiness routes | `app/routers/health.py` + `app/main.py` | Runtime paths unchanged; no legacy decorator ownership. |
| Infra and observability bootstrap | `app/bootstrap/` | Register from canonical entrypoint, not from `legacy_app.py`. |
| Domain logic | `core/` and `app/services/` | Backend truth stays outside route shims. |
| Public API contract | Backend OpenAPI gates | Legacy aliases must not become client contract truth. |

## Guard Contract

`scripts/ci/check_legacy_growth_guard.py` enforces this seam with static source
analysis. It parses `legacy_app.py` without importing application modules and
compares route, router-import, and sensitive-call facts against the frozen
baseline. Current facts may disappear as the seam shrinks; new facts fail
closed with repo-relative diagnostics.

The guard does not authorize runtime behavior. It only prevents unreviewed seam
growth while later extraction PRs move routes behind canonical routers.

## Exit Criteria

Retire this seam only when all are true:

1. `app/main.py` no longer depends on `legacy_app.app` as the runtime base.
2. Remaining compatibility aliases are either removed or implemented as bounded
   canonical router shims.
3. OpenAPI namespace guards stay deterministic after removal.
4. Auth, billing, export, insight, food-data, and websocket contracts have route
   parity coverage for any moved surface.
5. Backlog or PR governance records the final compatibility retirement evidence.

## Validation

Use:

```bash
python3 scripts/ci/check_legacy_growth_guard.py
pytest -q tests/test_legacy_growth_guard.py
```

This guard does not open runtime behavior, OpenAPI, semantic-cache serving,
FoodDB cutover, or broad refactor scope.
